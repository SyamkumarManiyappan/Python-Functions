What does the len() function do in Python? Write a code example using len() to find the length of a list.
Write a Python function greet(name) that takes a person's name as input and prints "Hello, [name]!".
Write a Python function find_maximum(numbers) that takes a list of integers and returns the maximum value without using the built-in max() function. Use a loop to iterate through the list and compare values.
Explain the difference between local and global variables in a Python function. Write a program where a global variable and a local variable have the same name and show how Python differentiates between them.
Create a function calculate_area(length, width=5) that calculates the area of a rectangle. If only the length is provided, the function should assume the width is 5. Show how the function behaves when called with and without the width argument.


Note: For the theory or explanatory parts of the questions, you may include your explanations as comments within the Python file itself. Alternatively, you can provide detailed explanations in a separate Word/PDF document and upload it along with your assignment.
